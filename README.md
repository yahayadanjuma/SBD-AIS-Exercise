# Software Architecture for Big Data - Exercise AIS WS 2025

During the next few exercises you are going learn how to build webservice Golang.

We're going to have a look at state-of-the-art server technologies, facilitate databases and communication protocols
such as gRPC, REST. This whole application will be containerized and can be deployed to a cluster.

This repository contains numbered folders, with every folder corresponding to one exercise (Exc_1-9).
Some exercises may provide a `skeleton/` folder to get you started with your assignment. 

## Modus Operandi
1. Fork this repository
2. Complete the exercise
3. Put the completed exercise in a `solution/` folder, i.e. `Exc_2/solution`
4. Push the solution to your GitHub repository
