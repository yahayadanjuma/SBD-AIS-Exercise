# Docker Compose for Exercise 4 (folder: Exc_4/skeleton)
# Goal: run PostgreSQL (db) + Go orderservice (app) on one shared bridge network,
#       with health checks, persistent storage, and explicit environment configuration.
# Presenter note: Compose reads this file and orchestrates both containers together.

# A readable project name; Compose prefixes created resources (networks, volumes, images).
# Presenter note: Using a unique name avoids clashes if you have other Compose projects running.
name: ordersystem-ex4

# All container definitions live under "services".
services:

  
  # PostgreSQL database (db)
  postgres:
    # Official Postgres image; pin a major/minor version for reproducible builds.
    image: postgres:16

    # Ensure the database comes back after host reboots unless you intentionally stop it.
    restart: unless-stopped

    # Expose the database on the host so local clients (psql, DBeaver) can connect.
    # Format "HOST:CONTAINER".
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

    # Core configuration for Postgres. Values resolve from .env if present; otherwise defaults apply.
    # Presenter note: Keeping creds in envs lets the same compose file work on any machine.
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB:-order}                 # logical DB name created at first start
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-docker}            # superuser to own the DB
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-docker}    # superuser password
      POSTGRES_TCP_PORT: ${POSTGRES_TCP_PORT:-5432}      # not commonly changed; here for completeness

    # Persist database files so "docker compose down" doesn’t erase your data.
    # Presenter note: Named volumes are managed by Docker; no host-path assumptions.
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

    # Healthcheck: Compose will wait for this to turn "healthy" before starting dependent services.
    # Presenter tip: $$ escapes $ inside YAML so the container sees $POSTGRES_USER.
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U $$POSTGRES_USER -d $$POSTGRES_DB"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 10

    # Attach DB to the same network as the app so they can resolve each other by service name.
    networks:
      - ordersystem-ex4-net

  # Go orderservice (app)
  orderservice:
    # Build an image for the app from the Dockerfile in THIS folder.
    build:
      # Build context is the current directory (Exc_4/skeleton).
      # Presenter note: Context = what gets sent to the Docker daemon for building.
      context: .
      # Use the Dockerfile that sits beside this compose file.
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile

    # Don’t start the app until Postgres is healthy (per healthcheck above).
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy

    # Publish the HTTP API out to your host.
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"          # visit http://localhost:3000

    # Inject environment variables from a local .env file next to this compose file.
    # Presenter note: This prevents hard-coding secrets in the compose file.
    env_file:
      - ./.env

    # Extra runtime envs. Inside the Docker network, "postgres" is the hostname (service name).
    environment:
      DB_HOST: postgres

    # Command to start the compiled Go binary inside the container.
    # Presenter note: this must match the binary path created by your Dockerfile build stage.
    command: ["/app/orderservice"]

    # Connect app to the same network as the DB.
    networks:
      - ordersystem-ex4-net


# Networking
# Create a user-defined bridge network for this stack.
# Presenter note: Using a unique name avoids conflicts with pre-existing networks (e.g., sbd3-net).
networks:
  ordersystem-ex4-net:
    name: ordersystem-ex4-net

# Persistent storage
# Named volume for Postgres data files so they survive container rebuilds.
